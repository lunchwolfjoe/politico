*I’ve cleaned up operations floors so broken they were bleeding money.*

<https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/
f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1dcb6cf-0892-4450-968e-26d0fa98ca17_1024x1536.jpeg>

I’ve walked into chaos—warehouses with no dock control, multimillion-
dollar shrink, and whole departments failing because the system was
built to fail.

And I fixed them. Not by adding more layers. But by cutting straight to
the problem.

That’s what Congress needs.

That’s what the entire federal government needs.

Not a committee. Not a task force. A chainsaw.

*Bureaucracy Isn’t Neutral. It’s a Fortress.*

Politicians pretend red tape is just “how government works.”

But let’s be real: bureaucracy is a weapon—a self-healing system of
friction, delay, and unaccountability that protects insiders and
punishes everyone else.

And here’s the trick:

It’s not about stopping bad policy.

It’s about making it impossible to change anything without permission
from a thousand layers of paper-pushers who’ve never built a damn thing.

*What It Actually Looks Like:*

  *

    You call the VA. They bounce you between six departments, then lose
    your claim.

  *

    You apply for a business license. The form asks if you’re a “wetland
    stakeholder.”

  *

    You build housing for veterans—only to be told you need a 2-year
    environmental study on an empty parking lot.

  *

    You try to fire a federal employee who hasn’t shown up for months—
    and HR says, “We’ll need three years of progressive discipline.”

This isn’t government.

This is protection racketeering with a fax machine.

*Who Benefits From Bureaucratic Bloat?*

*1. Career Insiders*

They know the backdoors. They have the email threads. They float between
government and lobbying gigs, never producing—just gatekeeping.

*2. Political Appointees*

Each administration stacks agencies with ideological hires who jam up
systems they don’t believe in—or worse, weaponize them.

*3. Big Corporations*

You think Amazon hates regulation? Not really.

They write half of it.

Because red tape doesn’t stop the giants. It crushes the mom-and-pop
competitor who can’t afford a lobbyist.

*Why It Never Gets Fixed*

Because every president promises to “cut red tape.”

But none of them swing the axe.

Why?

Because the second you try to trim it, the bureaucracy fights back.

Whistleblowers get buried. Reformers get sidelined. Inspectors General
get reassigned.

And the public? They just give up.

Until someone runs straight into the fire.

*I’ve Run Broken Systems Before. And I Know What Works.*

At Walmart and Amazon, I launched billion-dollar operations. I walked
into facilities on the brink of collapse and got them back online.

I’ve seen fraud, waste, laziness, arrogance—and I’ve fired people for it.

Because in the real world, when you waste time and money, you don’t get
a pension. You get replaced.

We need that mindset in Washington yesterday.

*What I’m Proposing: The Chainsaw Doctrine*

Not more “government efficiency task forces.”

Not PowerPoints. Not DEI audits. Not sensitivity training.

Just results. Just accountability. Just guts.

*1. Sunlight Audits on Every Federal Program*

Ty

Every agency must publish:

  *

    What programs exist

  *

    What they cost

  *

    Who’s responsible

  *

    When they last produced results

If they can’t prove impact, they’re done.

*2. Mandatory Sunset Clauses*

Every federal program or rule expires every 5 years unless reauthorized.

No more immortal policies. If it’s worth keeping, re-earn it.

*3. At-Will Termination for Federal Employees in Critical Roles*

You can’t run a nation if the dead weight can’t be removed.

I’m proposing discipline-based, at-will flexibility for critical
operational staff, including:

  *

    VA processors

  *

    IRS agents

  *

    Program auditors

  *

    HUD field reps

Do your job. Or don’t. But the system will no longer protect dead wood.

*4. A National Red Tape Repeal Platform*

Create a public-facing site where citizens can submit examples of waste
and get them reviewed by an independent “Cut Team.”

If we find 100 outdated regs? Gone.

If we find overlapping missions? Consolidate or cut.

Let the people help disinfect the rot.

*This Isn’t About Burning Down Government. It’s About Rebuilding It So
It Works.*

I’m not an anarchist. I’m an operator.

I know when a process is salvageable—and when it needs a chainsaw, not a
Band-Aid.

Washington doesn’t need more managers.

It needs fixers. Wreckers. Cleaners. Builders.

People who’ve actually run teams, hit deadlines, delivered results.

Because this is no longer just inefficiency.

It’s theft—of our time, our trust, and our tax dollars.

*I’m Nick Plumb. I don’t speak red tape. I cut through it.*

If you’ve ever been stuck in a line, ignored by an agency, or watched
billions vanish into a “pilot program” with no product—this fight is
yours too.

I’m not afraid of the system.

The system’s afraid of people like me.

If you’ve got a red tape horror story—send it in. I’ll publish the worst
offenders. Let’s make it a movement.
