My daughter didn’t get into the University of Texas.

<https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/
f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F858c43bc-833e-4796-b6f4-
c9645b397867_1024x1024.jpeg>

She’s a Texas kid. She has a 4.5 GPA. She’s headed to nationals with her
academic team. She got into Tulane, SMU, University of Denver and every
other state school she applied to —on scholarship. She’s done everything
we told her to do. Everything the system said would open doors.

But UT, the one she wanted —our own state’s flagship school—told her no.

Not because she wasn’t qualified. But because she’s white.

And because she’s graduating from a high school out of state, where her
mom lives.

That combination—white, high-achieving, out-of-state—puts her in the
worst possible lane in a system designed to serve metrics over merit.

And once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

*The Priorities Have Shifted*

At first glance, it seems contradictory: UT wants out-of-state tuition
dollars, right? So why turn away a top student from out of state?

Here’s the nuance:

UT, like many elite public schools, balances two incentives:

 1.

    Revenue: Full-pay out-of-state and international students help pad
    the budget.

 2.

    Representation: State and university leaders push for student bodies
    that meet demographic targets—racial, ethnic, and geographic.

So if you’re an out-of-state student who helps with diversity, you’re in
good shape.

If you’re an international student who pays full freight, you’re welcomed.

But if you’re an out-of-state white student, even from Texas? You’re
expendable.

You don’t hit their demographic goals.

And if you’re likely to get merit aid, you don’t help the bottom line
either.

That’s the trap my daughter fell into.

Too white for their politics.

Too out-of-state for their budget.

Too qualified to be ignored—but not “right” enough to be admitted.

*Meanwhile, In-State Seats Are Quietly Disappearing*

UT’s data tells the story:

  *

    White Texas-resident enrollment has dropped by nearly 5,000 students
    since 2016.

  *

    International enrollment has climbed to over 5,200 students.

  *

    Non-resident Asian student enrollment has increased year over year.

So while Texans pay taxes, fund the system, and raise kids who work hard
and aim high, the university system increasingly tells them:

“We’ve got other priorities.”

*This Doesn’t Stop at College*

Most international students don’t just study here—they stay.

They move from college into Optional Practical Training (OPT), then into
H1B work visas.

In theory, H1B is for roles Americans can’t fill.

In practice, I’ve worked in environments where nearly every role was
filled through global pipelines—not because Americans weren’t applying,
but because recruiting systems, sourcing channels, and legacy networks
quietly favored the international flow.

By the time a hiring manager sees resumes, the filters have already done
their job.

And if you’re not from a targeted university or inside a recruiter’s go-
to pool, you’re not getting through.

That’s not a meritocracy.

That’s a *systemic realignment*—away from American families, and toward
institutional self-interest.

*So What’s the Fix? Start With Accountability*

This isn’t about shutting the door. It’s about rebalancing it.

If a university receives taxpayer funding, it should prioritize
*taxpayer families*—period.

And if a company wants to sponsor an H1B visa, it should also fund the
*education of an American student*in that same field.

You want to hire global? Great. Pay it forward at home.

This isn’t punishment. It’s accountability.

It’s restoring balance in a system that’s quietly rigged against the
very people who built it.

*My Daughter Will Be Fine. But the Country Won’t Be If This Continues.*

She’ll thrive. She’s tough. She’s got options, and she’s earned them.

But I’m not okay staying quiet just because we landed on our feet.

Because here’s the real question:

*If she didn’t get in… what happens to the kid who had one shot?*

*What happens to the family with no backup plan?*

*What happens to a nation when it tells its best and brightest:*

*‘We don’t have a seat for you anymore’?*

That’s why I’m running.

To restore fairness.

To reset priorities.

To remind this country that it belongs to its people—first.

*Primary them all.*

Every seat. Every cycle. Until common sense and courage make a comeback.
