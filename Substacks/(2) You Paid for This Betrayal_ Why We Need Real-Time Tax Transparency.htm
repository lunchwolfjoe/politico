By N. Lee Plumb | April 25, 2025

/Every two weeks, millions of Americans open their paychecks and see the
familiar line/:

media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3ac3e994-fce2-48e2-
a4d6-418df738555f_1024x1536.jpeg>

*Federal Tax Withheld.*

Money, gone before it ever touched your hands.

Gone without consent, without conversation, without explanation.

We’ve all accepted it: this is just how things work.

But have you ever stopped to ask — *where exactly did that money go?*

Not broadly. Not “to the government” or “to programs.”

*Your*money. T*hat day*. *That paycheck*.

The answer?

You don’t know.

And *they don’t want you to know*.

*The Seize-and-Silence System*

Under today’s system, the federal government collects income taxes
through *automatic wage withholding.*Employers send a cut of your
paycheck directly to the Treasury, invisibly, painlessly — until you
realize what’s missing.

Once collected, those dollars are thrown into a black box of federal
accounts, shuffled among thousands of programs, payments, salaries, and
slush funds.

If you want to know where your money went?

Tough luck.

By the time “official” spending reports arrive — often months or years
later — the money is long spent, the decisions long made, and your voice
long ignored.

*You were forced to pay.*

*You had no say where it went.*

*You have no way to find out after the fact.*

That’s not democracy.

That’s a seizure with a shrug.

*If Venmo Can Track a $5 Coffee, Why Can’t the IRS Track $500?*

In 2025, we track everything in real time:

  *

    Every Amazon package.

  *

    Every Starbucks mobile order.

  *

    Every $5 Venmo transfer between friends.

Yet the government that demands trillions in taxes can’t — or won’t —
tell you where your $482 of withheld taxes went the same day it took it.

It’s not a technology problem.

It’s not a money problem.

It’s a power problem.

They don’t want you to know because if you could see it — *you might say
no.*

*You Fund the Very Institutions That Silence You*

And here’s the bitter truth they never say out loud:

*You are forced to fund the judiciary that subverts your vote.*

*And they won’t even show you the receipt.*

When activist judges override laws passed by your elected representatives —

  *

    voter ID laws,

  *

    immigration orders,

  *

    education reforms -

they don’t do it for free.

*You pay their salaries.*

*You fund their clerks.*

*You bankroll their marble courtrooms and lifetime pensions.*

Every time a federal court blocks your elected will,

your paycheck helped make it happen.

Wouldn’t it be nice to know, line by line,

  *

    how much of your taxes fund the judges who overrule your votes?

  *

    how much bankrolls bureaucrats who bury your voice in red tape?

  *

    how much subsidizes lawsuits against the very laws you passed?

Transparency isn’t just about numbers anymore.

It’s about survival.

If they fear your vote at the ballot box,

they damn sure fear your vote over their paychecks.

*The Legal Path They’re Desperate to Ignore*

Here’s what they’ll tell you if you demand real-time tax transparency:

“You can’t sue over taxes. The courts won’t allow it. It’s settled law.”

*Lie. Half-truth. Intimidation.*

The Tax *Anti-Injunction Act*bars lawsuits that try to stop tax
collection — not ones that demand transparency *after*collection.

And under the *Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause*, if they seize your
property, they owe you basic fairness — including telling you how it’s used.

Plus, under the *Administrative Procedure Act *and the*Digital
Accountability and Transparency Act*, federal agencies are already
required to disclose spending.

The legal path is clear:

  *

    *Sue for transparency, not to stop taxes.*

  *

    *Use constitutional due process.*

  *

    *Invoke federal transparency law violations.*

  *

    *Drag the IRS and Treasury into open court and force them to admit:
    “We can show you where your money goes. We just don’t want to.”*

*This Is the Battle They Can’t Win*

If we demand it, they will lose.

Because the truth is simple:

*If they can seize your paycheck in real time, they can damn well tell
you where it went in real time.*

It’s our money.

It’s our government.

And it’s long past time we started acting like it.

*#LiveMyTaxes*

*#TaxTransparency*

*#WageFreedom*
