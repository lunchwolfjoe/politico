f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86f1fed4-00fd-4cd7-82f8-702f659a3ea0_1536x1024.jpeg>

Let’s keep it simple.

Here’s how tech really worked until very recently:

Say a company wanted to build a new app — something basic, like an app
to order parts for your truck.

Before AI, building that app needed a lot of people:

First, a Business Analyst sat with the customer and wrote 50 pages
describing every feature.

Then a Project Manager set up meetings, made schedules, and managed
deadlines.

Then Software Developers wrote thousands of lines of code manually,
piece by piece.

Then QA Testers clicked through every screen to find mistakes.

Then Technical Writers created user guides and manuals.

It took months.

It took dozens of people.

It cost hundreds of thousands — sometimes millions — of dollars.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, with AI?

One smart builder can load a few ideas into an AI system.

The AI designs the product.

The AI writes most of the code.

The AI tests the code by simulating thousands of users.

The AI writes the manuals and documentation automatically.

It doesn’t take 50 people anymore.

It doesn’t even take 10.

It takes 1 or 2.

And a lot less money.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s why this collapse is going to hit all of us — not just tech workers:

A lot of those extra people — the business analysts, testers, junior
developers — were immigrants here on H1B visas.

When they lose their jobs, they lose their visas.

They have to leave the country — fast.

Tens of thousands of apartments and homes go empty.

Rents collapse. Home prices crash.

Local businesses — restaurants, gyms, daycare centers — lose customers.

City tax revenue falls.

Schools lose funding.

Police and fire services get cut.

And it doesn’t stop there.

When the middle collapses, every community feels it —

whether you clean floors, drive a truck, fix engines, stock shelves, or
manage a diner.

You’re not protected just because you don’t work in tech.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Collapse Chain:*

Tech jobs disappear.

Tech workers leave.

Local spending dries up.

Small businesses close.

Home prices crash.

City budgets implode.

Schools lose funding.

Public services get worse.

Crime, anger, and protests rise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here’s the part nobody in Washington is telling you:

The collapse has already started.

Tech hubs are already seeing record layoffs, record empty offices, and
record downtown business closures.

Meanwhile, your politicians are still talking about job training
programs for jobs that aren’t even going to exist anymore.

They are not ready.

They have no plan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The Only Way Forward:*

Admit the old system is dead.

Stop pouring money into dead structures.

Start rebuilding local economies around real skills, real value, and
real resilience.

No more pretending.

We either get in front of this —

or get buried by it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The collapse doesn’t care what you do for a living.*

*It’s coming anyway.*
