No Lame Politicians

*Elections aren’t suggestions. They’re mandates.*

In 2024, Americans sent a clear message—especially in border states:

Fix immigration. Secure the southern border. Get control of the chaos.

That wasn’t a fringe issue. It was the issue.

  *

    It flipped races.

  *

    It dominated debates.

  *

    It crossed party lines.

  *

    And it became the reason many voters held their nose and made a choice.

The people spoke.

But when the president tried to act, he didn’t face opposition from
Congress.

He faced a robe.

*This Isn’t a Legal Debate. It’s a Constitutional Crisis.*

Today, the President of the United States can:

  *

    Be elected with a clear policy mandate

  *

    Draft and issue executive orders within legal precedent

  *

    Respond to national security threats

  *

    And still be blocked—not by the people, not by Congress, but by a
    federal judge

Often a single one.

And while the case drags out for months—or years—the action dies on the
vine.

*Immigration: The Front Line of Judicial Veto Power*

Let’s be blunt: this isn’t theoretical. It’s happening right now.

Recent examples:

  *

    The administration restricted asylum to those who entered legally—
    blocked.

  *

    It attempted mass deportation of criminal non-citizens—stayed.

  *

    It paused humanitarian parole programs during surges—frozen.

  *

    It tried to expand border technology infrastructure—tied up in
    litigation.

Each of these actions reflected what millions of voters demanded.

But instead of Congress stepping in to resolve the issue, the courts
became the final word.

This isn’t checks and balances.

This is governance by judicial injunction.

*Congress Isn’t Neutral. It’s Absent.*

The founders didn’t give courts the power to set national immigration
policy.

That power belongs to:

  *

    The President (in real-time response)

  *

    Congress (through legislation)

But today’s Congress is:

  *

    Holding hearings with no bills

  *

    Grandstanding on camera

  *

    Passing off responsibility

  *

    And allowing unelected judges to do the job they refuse to do

This isn’t balance.

This is cowardice.

*If Congress Won’t Act, Who Actually Governs?*

Let’s zoom out.

  *

    The people elect a president to enact a platform.

  *

    The president acts using existing legal authority.

  *

    The courts block that action—often citing “harm” to non-citizens or
    abstract procedural grounds.

  *

    And Congress does nothing to resolve the gridlock.

At that point, it’s not a government anymore.

It’s a legal hostage situation.

And the hostage is the will of the people.

*The Delay Is the Damage. Again.*

Even if the executive wins on appeal, by the time the ruling comes down:

  *

    The border has surged.

  *

    The incentives have changed.

  *

    The headlines are gone.

  *

    The political will has cooled.

  *

    And the damage is already done.

Victory delayed is mandate denied.

*What Congress Should Be Doing—Right Now*

This is not about left or right. It’s about constitutional responsibility.

*1. Codify Presidential Authority to Secure the Border*

Congress must reaffirm that the executive branch can:

  *

    Restrict entry during surges

  *

    Prioritize deportations

  *

    Pause humanitarian loopholes during emergencies

  *

    Deploy active barriers, personnel, and technology

*2. Establish Fast-Track Judicial Reviews for Emergency Actions*

If a federal judge blocks executive action during a declared national
security or border emergency, the case must be reviewed by an appellate
court within 30 days.

No more slow-roll sabotage.

*3. Require Legislative Response to Major Injunctions*

When a court freezes a major executive action, Congress must vote within
30 days on whether to:

  *

    Support the court’s ruling

  *

    Override it through emergency statute

  *

    Or take no position (and be held accountable for that silence)

Make Congress go on the record.

*4. Reclaim Legislative Authority Over Immigration*

If courts are setting policy through rulings, Congress must re-legislate
the scope and limit of those powers.

Right now, the ambiguity benefits only those who profit from delay and
dysfunction.

*The Founders Warned Us About This*

The judiciary was never meant to govern.

It was meant to interpret—not override the people’s voice through
procedural warfare and permanent injunctions.

And Congress? It was meant to lead.

Not tweet.

Not stall.

Not pass the buck to the next session.

Lead.

*I’m Nick Plumb. I don’t care which party holds power. I care whether
the people do.*

I’ve served in warzones and watched delay kill.

I’ve served in Guantanamo and watched legal systems collapse under their
own weight.

I’ve worked inside massive systems—and I’ve turned them around.

And I can tell you this:

If courts can quietly nullify elections, and Congress keeps pretending
that’s “checks and balances”—then we’ve lost the republic.

*Elections aren’t suggestions. They’re mandates.*

If the people elect a leader to secure the border, then that leader must
have the tools, the speed, and the legal authority to do it.

And if unelected judges stand in the way, Congress must act—not hide.

No more governance by lawsuit.

No more silence from the legislature.

No more veto by robe.

/Share this with someone who still believes elections matter. Because if
we don’t defend the mandate, we’re just running simulations of democracy
—and nobody’s in charge./
