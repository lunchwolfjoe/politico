Congress doesn’t understand H1B.

<https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/
f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67b4bac5-6768-4c5d-b25e-
f8dbe8093831_1024x1024.jpeg>

And the reason they don’t is simple: *they’ve never built anything.*

They’ve never led a night shift where the team is short-staffed and
everyone’s watching.

They’ve never run a floor with performance on the line and systems breaking.

They’ve never had to choose between the ideal and the executable—because
in real leadership, that choice happens every day.

I’ve been there.

I’ve run billion-dollar operations.

I’ve staffed teams in tech and logistics, on launch days and blackout
periods, with global vendors and local labor.

And I’ve seen exactly how the H1B system is used—not for what it was
intended, but for what it enables: *control, cost savings, and quiet
displacement*.

*This Isn’t Taught in MBA Programs*

You won’t learn this in business school case studies.

You won’t hear it in sanitized HR whitepapers.

And no amount of veteran preference training in a military transition
course prepares you for what really happens in modern corporate labor
planning.

H1B abuse is subtle, systemic, and deeply woven into how companies operate.

And most of the people in Congress couldn’t explain how a hire gets made
if their seat depended on it.

*Here’s How It Works in the Real World*

  *

    A role opens.

  *

    Sourcing pulls a list—not from the general market, but from an
    optimized funnel filled with sponsored candidates.

  *

    Managers see what’s passed forward. What they don’t see? The
    filtered-out Americans who never made it past the algorithm or the
    vendor gate.

No one’s breaking the law.

They’re just following a system that was designed to work like this.

H1B isn’t solving a labor crisis. It’s perpetuating a *compliance
culture*that rewards risk aversion over local investment.

And unless you’ve led inside that kind of system, you won’t even realize
it’s happening.

*This Is a Leadership Problem*

The reason no one in Congress is talking about this isn’t just political
correctness—it’s lack of *competence*.

They don’t know how teams get staffed.

They don’t understand workforce planning.

And they’ve never had to answer for why an entire function failed
because a hiring pipeline was misaligned.

So they stay quiet.

And when they do speak up, it’s all buzzwords and surface-level analysis.

But people in the field? They know.

They feel it when their resumes go unanswered.

They feel it when their job is offshored, outsourced, or silently
transferred to someone they’re asked to train.

And they’re tired of being told this is just the free market at work.

It’s not. It’s a rigged pipeline built by people who’ve never had to
manage the downstream impact.

*What Needs to Happen*

If you’ve never run a shift, you don’t understand operational pressure.

If you’ve never built a team from zero, you don’t understand hiring
pressure.

And if you’ve never had to meet a quota while protecting morale,
quality, and trust—you should not be writing labor policy.

That’s what’s broken here.

It’s not just the laws. It’s the leadership.

So yes, we need to reform H1B. But more than that, we need to reform who
we’re sending to write the rules in the first place.

*Primary them all*.

Every seat. Every cycle. Until experience replaces excuse.
