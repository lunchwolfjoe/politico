*Incompetence isn’t the biggest threat in government. Indifference is.*

We’re told America still works—we’re just a little behind.

That if we wait our turn, stay calm, and be patient, the system will
deliver.

But I’m here to tell you what veterans, working parents, whistleblowers,
and honest taxpayers already know:

The delay is the damage.

*They Don’t Need to Silence You. They Just Need to Stall You.*

This is how power protects itself now:

  *

    A veteran waits 6 months for an appeal.

  *

    A parent waits 18 months for a special education hearing.

  *

    A small business waits 9 months for a grant—but the money’s already
    gone.

  *

    A wrongfully fired worker waits 3 years for resolution—and loses
    their house in the meantime.

You weren’t denied. You were just told to wait.

But your rent didn’t wait. Your depression didn’t wait. Your kid didn’t
stop growing.

*I’ve Lived It. I’ve Watched It. I’ve Fought Through It.*

I served in Iraq, Guantanamo, and at CJSOTF–AP—Combined Joint Special
Operations Task Force – Arabian Peninsula.

I’ve sat in command tents where decisions had to be made now, not after
a committee reviewed the blast radius.

I’ve also sat on the phone with the VA, listening to music loops for
hours, trying to get basic care approved.

One system ran like life depended on it.

The other ran like yours didn’t.

*Delay Isn’t a Flaw. It’s a Feature.*

In Washington, delay serves the powerful.

  *

    Bureaucrats delay until you give up.

  *

    Agencies delay until the press cycle ends.

  *

    Corporations delay until your lawyer runs out of money.

  *

    Schools delay until your kid “ages out.”

  *

    Tech platforms delay appeals until your momentum is gone.

They’ll never tell you “no” directly.

They’ll just say “We’re reviewing your case.”

“We’re still evaluating.”

“You’re in line.”

And by the time your number’s called—you’ve already lost.

*This Is Systemic Psychological Warfare*

Delay demoralizes.

Delay discourages.

Delay defunds movements and drains resolve.

And it disproportionately hurts:

  *

    The poor

  *

    The sick

  *

    The honest

  *

    The vulnerable

  *

    The ones who don’t have lawyers, publicists, or time to spare

The elite don’t wait.

They have fixers.

You have hold music.

*If You’ve Never Had to Wait on the System, You Don’t Know It’s Broken*

The people who say “everything’s working” are the people who’ve never
needed it urgently.

But if you’ve ever been:

  *

    A veteran waiting for your benefits

  *

    A whistleblower waiting for your name to be cleared

  *

    A student waiting for financial aid

  *

    A parent waiting for care approval

  *

    A citizen waiting for justice—

You know the truth.

Delay is the currency of cowards.

And the system is rich in it.

*What I’m Proposing: A Culture of Immediate Accountability*

Every government system—local, state, federal—must be reengineered for
speed, clarity, and consequence.

*1. Maximum Response Timelines – Enforced*

Every agency must have a hard timeline to respond to citizen claims, and
if they miss it:

  *

    You get a human case review

  *

    You get escalation power

  *

    And they get docked performance funding

Let delay have a cost.

*2. Public Dashboarding of Pending Claims and Appeals*

Let’s bring sunlight to the stall tactics.

Every VA claim, IRS review, EEOC appeal, or housing voucher delay should
be publicly visible by timeline category.

If an agency’s delaying veterans, we should see it.

*3. Emergency Fast-Track Protocols for Critical Cases*

Just like a trauma unit, some cases deserve red-light priority.

Veterans at suicide risk. Parents with unstable housing. Victims of
retaliation.

These should go to a special triage desk with authority to act immediately.

*4. Legislative Reviews Must Trigger Outcomes, Not Optics*

Congressional investigations and hearings should be scored by the policy
outcome, not the airtime.

If you spend 6 months grilling tech CEOs and don’t pass a bill—your
committee gets its budget cut.

*The Delay Is the Damage. And It’s Time to Stop Pretending Otherwise.*

This isn’t a new problem. But it’s now a designed one.

Delay is how the system protects itself without ever saying “no.”

It doesn’t have to punish you—it just has to wait you out.

And I’m not going to let that stand.

*I’m Nick Plumb. I’ve waited. I’ve fought. And I’ve had enough.*

I’m running for Congress because people deserve urgency.

They deserve answers.

And they deserve a system that moves as fast as their crisis.

If you’ve ever sat on hold, got denied by silence, or watched justice
rot while the file “worked its way through,”—I’m fighting for you.

The delay is the damage.

Let’s cut the line.

Let’s cut the excuses.

Let’s cut through it.

Drop your worst delay story in the comments. Let’s name the agencies.
Let’s crowdsource the truth. Let’s bring the pressure.

My delay story? I was stuck waiting for the post office to update my
address in Miami, while the apartment company refused to lift a finger.
Total stalemate.
