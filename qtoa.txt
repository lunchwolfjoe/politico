What is your candidate's personal story or journey that led them to run for office? (What moments or experiences shaped their decision?)

My life started out rocky, my young mother made choices which led to my adoption by the age of 4. My late adopted parents who were born in 1930 and 1933 raised me to believe in God, family and the value of hard work. The day I turned 18, my dad gave me four options: Army, Navy, Air Force or the Marine Corps, I choose the Army and left for service shortly after graduation from high school. After the Army, I would go on spend 6 more years in the Navy.
Upon my return from service, I went to work for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation where I worked for the General Counsel but was struggling with the relatively slow tempo as compared to the military and took a chance on myself and went to work at Walmart. My goal was simple, get my foot in the door and then out-compete others - by my third anniversary with the company, I was the Store Manager of the third highest volume and most profitible store in the chain. 
After 7 years with Walmart, I was presented the opportunity to go to work for Amazon to launch new fullfilment centers. Today, after three record breaking launches and a worldwind journey of learning, I lead AI Enablement for Amazon's Global Compensation team. I believe I've achieved what I have because I didn't have a safety net, I didn't have parents to fall back on or a trust fund to drain. Instead of living the global doldrum, I lived the American dream and want to ensure that pathway remains in place for my children and their children.
