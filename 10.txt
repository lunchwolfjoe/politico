I’m not running to become something. I’m running because too many of the wrong people already have. This isn’t a launch announcement. It’s a line in the sand. I’m not here to shake hands and angle for endorsements. I’m here because I’ve watched this country hand the keys to people who’ve never built anything—people who’d fall apart if they ever had to live the kind of life they legislate for the rest of us. (68)

This isn’t a campaign. It’s a correction. A reset. I’ve led on the floor. I’ve led in war zones. I’ve led when the power was out, when the freight was late, when the policy was garbage and people still needed someone to show up. And now I’m watching the same kind of rot I’ve spent my life fixing take root in every institution that used to hold this country together. (63)

So no—I don’t talk like a politician. I don’t dress like one. I don’t move in their circles. But I’ve out-executed every Ivy League strategy deck they’ve ever thrown at me. I’ve recovered half a billion in fraud without a finance degree. I’ve turned failing teams into record-breakers. I’ve done more with a whiteboard and a payroll file than most of them have done with a $10 million think tank budget. (63)

1. Working-Class Empowerment

I’ve been poor. Not “tight budget” poor—Y-shower, porta potty, sell-your-car-to-eat poor. And I never took a dime of welfare. I clawed my way back with busted knuckles and a borrowed truck. So when I say the system is rigged against working-class Americans, I’m not theorizing. I lived it. While politicians were polishing talking points, I was patching drywall with my last twenty bucks. That’s why I’m running. To be the firewall between the forgotten and the fake. (71)

I want trade schools funded like Ivy Leagues. I want tax policy that favors the man who installs HVACs, not the hedge fund that buys the company out from under him. I want a government that builds around producers again—not professional victims, not policy parasites, not HR managers masquerading as mission-critical. I want blue-collar America back in charge of this country’s direction—because when we lead, things work. (61)

2. Border Truth

Let’s stop calling it a crisis. It’s an invasion—one we’re pretending is humanitarian so the ruling class can keep their labor cheap and their guilt clean. But it’s not clean. It’s bloody. I’ve seen what comes through those border sectors: cartel scouts, fentanyl by the kilo, sex trafficking victims too broken to speak. And I’ve seen our own government stand down—because they’re more afraid of headlines than dead Texans. (66)

You don’t fix the border with tweets. You fix it with policy that bites. You shut it down. You station the Guard. You fund the counties doing the federal government’s job. And if D.C. sues us, we sue them back—for every overdose, every kidnapped child, every shattered ranch that’s had to bury the cost of federal cowardice. I’m not asking. I’m stating. Texas leads—or Texas bleeds. (62)

3. The Coming AI Transition

AI isn’t coming. It’s already here. It’s deciding hiring slates, routing freight, filtering resumes, scanning sentiment, and rewriting entire workflows—quietly, invisibly, and without public consent. I know because I’ve built it. I’ve written the logic. I’ve seen how fast it replaces tasks that used to require entire departments. And I’ve watched, in real time, as executives chase efficiency while ignoring the fallout that’s coming for their own people. (67)

The next five years will make or break the American workforce. We can lead this transition, or we can let it devour us. We need policies that don’t just prepare workers for what’s next—they demand corporations be honest about the shifts already underway. I’m talking AI job impact disclosures. Transition funding tied to retraining. Incentives for companies that protect real skill. Penalties for those who lie about replacement timelines. (63)

This isn’t sci-fi. This is now. And if we don’t lead from the front, we’re going to wake up with 30 million broken promises and a Congress full of people who still think ChatGPT is a band. Not on my watch. (41)

4. The Broken Judiciary

We have a judicial system that no longer interprets law—it invents it. Judges bench-legislating from both ends of the spectrum, striking down laws they don’t like, rewriting policy with rulings that sound more like blog posts than constitutional analysis. That’s not justice. That’s tyranny in a robe. And Congress? Too scared to say a word. Because they’ve forgotten the courts answer to the Constitution—not the other way around. (66)
[Total: 691]

I’ve worked in legal ops. I’ve seen good judges boxed out and political hacks elevated. We’ve got a system that moves faster for criminals than it does for veterans, parents, or citizens just trying to survive the state. Immigration policy? Frozen by the courts. Parental rights? Undermined from the bench. And all the while, Congress shrugs, blames process, and cashes the check. I’m not doing that. I’ll say the thing nobody else will: If courts want to override elected law, they should be ready for elected accountability. (72)

5. Rigged Education

We were sold a lie. That education was the great equalizer. That if you worked hard, studied hard, and followed the rules, opportunity would come. I believed it. My daughter lived it. And then we found out what the system actually rewards: boxes checked, demographics targeted, and narratives pushed. She had a 4.5 GPA, national-level awards, and a resume that should’ve guaranteed acceptance. But UT said no. Not because of merit. Because merit’s been replaced. (66)

We don’t have an education system. We have an indoctrination engine. One that punishes excellence and celebrates grievance. One that teaches kids to hate the very foundation that gave them freedom to learn in the first place. And we fund it—blindly, annually, and without a shred of oversight. I’ll change that. Starting with transparency. Starting with merit. Starting with nuking the bureaucracies that made our schools factories for failure. (63)

No more DEI coordinators earning six figures while classrooms fall apart. No more admissions offices running race-based algorithms while veterans’ kids get shut out. If a school can’t prioritize the children of citizens who built this country, then maybe it shouldn’t be funded by the citizens at all. (50)

This isn’t a platform. It’s a blueprint for disruption. Every line of it forged in the places these politicians avoid: shop floors, broken docks, VA waiting rooms, tuition hearings, courtrooms where truth loses to loopholes. I didn’t come from money, pedigree, or legacy. I came from the crawlspaces of American failure—patched them, painted them, and figured out how to rebuild. (63)

And that’s why I’m dangerous to them. Not because I’m loud. Because I’m right. Because I’ve lived what they’ve only studied. Because I don’t need a poll to know what matters—I’ve felt it in the drywall dust, the court transcripts, the tuition bills, the shift handoffs, and the silence that happens when the government leaves you behind. (61)

I don’t want their seat. I want to burn down the process that protects them. I want to make it so that no working parent ever has to beg a university their taxes fund to let their kid in. So no veteran ever hears “you missed the deadline by four days” from a clerk who’s never worn the uniform. So no man who fixes things for a living ever feels like the country he built doesn’t need him anymore. (66)

They don’t see me coming. That’s their mistake. I’ve spent a lifetime being underestimated—by teachers, by bosses, by institutions that didn’t know what to do with someone who wouldn’t quit and couldn’t be shaped. And now I’m bringing all of that to the one place most in need of an operational overhaul: Congress. (56)

I’m not built for handshakes and fundraisers. I’m built for breaking bottlenecks. I don’t do well in green rooms or gala dinners. But put me in front of a broken system, and I’ll tear it down, map the failure, and rebuild it with fewer moving parts and a hell of a lot more honesty. I’ve done it in warehouses. I’ve done it in courtrooms. I’ve done it with no money, no favors, and no backup. Now I’m doing it in Washington. (66)

Because this isn’t about being electable. It’s about being effective. It’s about walking into a government that’s rotted from the inside and saying, “I’m not here to collaborate—I’m here to clean house.” It’s about being the guy who doesn’t ask for a vote to pass a bill—he just stands up, tells the damn truth, and lets the chips fall. (59)

So if you’re comfortable, I’m not your guy. If you want safe, polished, consultant-approved slogans, vote for the next Dan Crenshaw. But if you’re ready for someone who’s lived what you’ve lived—fought what you’ve fought—bled, clawed, and earned every inch of ground under his boots… then I’m your man. (57)

I’m not here to blend in. I’m here to end the excuses. I’m here to call out the frauds. I’m here to stand on the House floor and say what no one else will: that the working class has had enough. That the veterans have had enough. That the builders, the believers, the broken who keep getting back up—we’re done waiting. We’re taking it back. (61)
