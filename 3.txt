Chapter 3: One Way Up

When I stepped off active duty in 2011, I went right back to the job I’d held before the Navy: the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. Civilian legal work. Nothing flashy. It wasn’t the worst place in the world, but it moved at the speed of glue compared to what I’d just come from. I’d just rotated off a CJSOTF assignment, where everything was red-line urgency, life-and-death tempo, and operational chaos. Then I walked back into a cubicle where people spent twenty minutes arguing about font size. I knew right then I wouldn’t last. (87)

My body was healing, but my mind was pacing. I was used to thinking in layers—rules, threats, outcomes. TDLR didn’t demand that. It asked for form completion and record retention. No disrespect to the people working there, but I wasn’t wired to shuffle paperwork until retirement. I needed something with friction. Something that moved. Something that meant something. (56)

I didn’t say any of that out loud. I just sat in my chair, tapped through regulatory tasks, and tried to ignore the feeling that I’d been put in a cage with good lighting. That’s where I was when I saw the article—some issue of Fortune magazine sitting in a waiting room. “Walmart recruits military leaders for store management.” I didn’t even finish the piece. I got up, went back to my desk, and filled out the application. (66)

The idea didn’t scare me. It made sense. Walmart wasn’t sexy, but it was scale. Operations. Logistics. People. Conflict. All the stuff I knew how to handle. And if they were hiring officers to do it, I figured—If an officer could do it, I knew I could. I didn’t need a salute. I needed a chance. (52)

I didn’t hear back immediately. Weeks passed. I kept showing up at TDLR, doing the job, waiting for the next move. When they finally called, it felt like a confirmation—someone still saw value in the kind of grit I brought. The woman on the phone was respectful but formal. She asked me to submit some background info, walk through my service history, and complete an in-person interview in Round Rock. I didn’t hesitate. I drove out the same week. (69)

The guy who interviewed me—his name escapes me now—was all business. No filler. He walked me through scenarios: staffing issues, customer complaints, shrink reduction, managing chaos. I answered every question from the only lens I had—truth, tempo, outcomes. I didn’t pretend to be something I wasn’t. I told him I’d never worked in retail. That I didn’t know how inventory systems worked. But I also told him I’d handled legal prep in war zones, briefed senior leaders under pressure, and led people who’d bleed for me. “If you can teach me the systems,” I said, “I’ll break your records.” (85)

He leaned back, smiled, and said, “That’s what we’re looking for.” I was in. Just like that. No degree. No corporate polish. Just a résumé of scars and wins. I’d barely made it back home before the onboarding packet hit my email. I was going to be an Assistant Manager Trainee in Round Rock, Texas. Entry-level leadership. But to me, it felt like being commissioned all over again. (61)

The first day hit different. Retail wasn’t just fast—it was unpredictable. Customers didn’t act like soldiers. Hourly associates didn’t move because you outranked them. And the metrics? They weren’t about mission success. They were about margin, profit, and performance curves. I was surrounded by civilians who had grown up in that system—people who didn’t need to ask where the planogram binder was or what the shift cadence looked like. I was behind from day one. And I loved it. (70)

At first, I kept my mouth shut and watched. That was my move—always had been. Let the other managers posture, let the lifers show off. I didn’t need to be seen. I needed to understand the system: how freight moved, how inventory was tracked, where shrink hid, and most of all—who the real workers were. Not just the names on the schedule. The actual pulse. The associates who made or broke a shift. (62)

It didn’t take long to see the patterns. There were employees who showed up early, never clocked out for breaks, and kept the aisles clean without being asked. And there were others who were ghosts—always “on task,” never producing anything. I didn’t call them out. I just made notes. Like I was building a playbook for a game no one knew we were in. (54)

One night, I walked the GM side before close. Backroom was chaos. Pallets stacked wrong, freight spilling onto the floor, dock door open with no associate in sight. I called for a lead. No response. Called again—nothing. Finally walked outside to find two guys smoking by the dumpster while an entire inbound load sat untouched. I didn’t yell. I just told them, “You’ve got ten minutes to fix it. Then I start documenting.” And walked away. (67)

Next day, I had a conversation with the store manager. Told him what I saw. Told him what I did. Expected him to say I overstepped. Instead, he nodded and said, “Good. That dock’s been a problem for weeks. Sounds like they finally met someone who noticed.” That moment lit a fuse. I realized I didn’t need to wait for permission. I could enforce standards just by showing I gave a damn. (61)

I started showing up early. Not in a performative way—but because I needed to feel the building before the chaos started. I wanted to see who arrived on time without being chased. Who leaned on their broom like it was a cane, and who hustled because it was just in their nature. I greeted everyone by name. Not because I was trying to be popular—but because I knew what it felt like to be treated like a ghost. (64)

When night crews finished, I’d walk the floor with them. Not to inspect. To listen. They told me what was broken, what was missing, what never worked—but no one upstairs seemed to care. So I fixed what I could. Escalated what I couldn’t. And followed up every damn time. That’s when things started to shift. They didn’t smile. They didn’t thank me. They just started executing better. Because they knew someone was watching who actually saw them. (65)

Some of the other managers didn’t like it. They thought I was “too intense.” One even pulled me aside and said, “You’re making the rest of us look bad.” I just smiled and said, “Then do better.” I wasn’t there to make friends. I was there to build something. And building doesn’t require consensus. It requires standards. (54)

About six weeks in, the store manager asked me to walk a comp aisle and call out resets. I took the task seriously—probably more than he expected. I spent hours after close with a clipboard, auditing placement, checking velocities, noting dead stock. When I brought it back, he flipped through it and said, “Most people half-ass this. You gave me a blueprint.” I told him it wasn’t hard. “You just have to give a shit.” (60)

That’s when he started bringing me into conversations I wasn’t supposed to be in yet. Inventory prep. Leadership pipeline. Sales forecasting. I didn’t say much—but I learned. Every meeting was another puzzle piece. I wasn’t waiting for someone to hand me the keys. I was building a map to get there myself. (49)

I didn’t ask for a promotion. I earned one before I knew it was coming. The store manager brought me into the office one afternoon and said, “You ever been north?” I asked how far. He said, “North Dakota. Minot. Oil boom town. They need leadership bad.” It wasn’t a request. It was an opportunity—disguised as exile. (50)

I took it. No hesitation. Packed up and moved north without knowing anyone. When I got there, I saw the truth immediately—chaos. Overflowing freight. Inexperienced department managers. Stores drowning in volume. The oil boom had created a strange kind of wealth—roughnecks with cash and nowhere to spend it but Walmart. The store printed money, but it bled talent. I was there to stop the bleeding. (59)

The first winter damn near broke me. Wind chill hit -50. Trucks froze. Workers called out. The only thing that ran on time was expectation. But I’d already learned how to lead in weather like this—not literal, but structural. I kept showing up. Kept leading from the floor. Kept pulling new associates out of the fire before they burned out. Some stayed. Some didn’t. But they all saw me in the aisles with them, not in the break room. That mattered. (61)

That store taught me what real pressure looked like. Not war zone pressure—volume pressure. Boxes. Payroll. Scheduling. We were doing $100 million in annual revenue out of a single location, and there were days it felt like I was holding it together with duct tape and sheer will. But we kept it moving. We hit goals. We built a culture. And for the first time since leaving the military, I felt like I was building something of my own again. (65)

Minot was tough. Williston was tougher. They called it a Focus Store—a corporate term for “this place is bleeding, and we’re watching.” I was offered the transfer with a smile and a handshake, but I knew what it meant. It meant you were either going to fix the place—or die trying. I took the keys anyway. (52)

The building was a mess. Turnover was nonstop. AP was overwhelmed. Freight was behind. The break room smelled like old mop water and resentment. But I’d been here before—different name, same chaos. I didn’t panic. I just walked the floor, shook hands, and started setting expectations one department at a time. (48)

My first goal was shrink. That store had some of the worst numbers in the company. I didn’t blame the associates—I blamed the systems. So I built my own. Audits. Walkthroughs. Partnering with AP. I taught every team lead how to spot theft patterns and correct process gaps. I tracked it all myself. Week by week, the trend reversed. (49)

I’ll never forget the day the inventory results posted. My AP manager walked in with the final number and said, “You’re not gonna believe this.” We’d cut shrink by more than half. No tricks. No inflated counts. Just execution. I told him I believed it. We earned every inch of that margin. (47)

That same month, I got the receipt. You know the one. “If you’re not satisfied, call and speak to [Your Name] at [Store Number].” I didn’t frame it or laminate it. I just stared at it for a while and thought: There it is. Proof. Not that I’d made it. But that I could. (50)

I should’ve seen it coming. Not the incident—but the way things were lining up. I’d just wrapped a tough quarter. Shrink was low. Morale was high. We were finally running clean. But when you push that hard, that fast, it makes people nervous—especially the ones who weren’t pulling weight. I had a co-manager who didn’t like me. Quiet about it. Subtle. But I saw the glances. The cold shoulders. The way they always managed to be on break when something got hard. (60)

That day started like any other. Morning freight. Safety sweep. I was walking the front end when I saw a group of shoplifters heading for the door. It wasn’t subtle—backpacks full of unpaid merchandise, sprinting for the exit. Our AP caught one clean. I caught another—not with force, not with rage, but with presence. Blocked the door, extended an arm, and physically stopped them from pushing past me. They turned and bolted. I didn’t chase. I just stood my ground. (65)

It wasn’t violent. It wasn’t even dramatic. But it was policy violation—because I’d made physical contact. Not a tackle. Not a punch. Just a stop. A moment. Enough for a bad-faith peer to report it. And that’s exactly what happened. The co-manager I’d been holding accountable? They went straight to corporate. Reported me for use of force. (53)

By end of day, I was in the office. HR. Market rep. “We reviewed the footage.” I sat quiet. Let them talk. Then I asked, “Did we recover the merchandise?” They said yes. I said, “Then I did my job.” They said, “You violated policy.” And that was it. Done. Fired. (45)

The kicker? Inventory results came back that same day. We’d posted some of the lowest shrink numbers in the company. I should’ve been celebrated. I was terminated. The same people who’d looked the other way for months suddenly found their voice when I enforced a standard they never had the courage to hold. (50)

I didn’t argue. Didn’t ask for a second chance. I just stood up, nodded, and walked out with my box. Years of effort reduced to a few signatures and a printout. No one told the store. No exit speech. No thank-you. The same hands I’d shaken, the same associates I’d fought for—they just saw me vanish. (50)

That’s the thing about doing the right thing in the wrong system—it rarely rewards you. But it still leaves a mark. I knew I hadn’t failed. I’d built a culture. Cut shrink. Protected product. Led with presence. But none of that fit neatly inside a corporate compliance policy. The system didn’t care about context. Only headlines. And in theirs, I was gone. (56)

I didn’t feel shame. I felt fury. Not the kind that makes you lash out—but the kind that sharpens. I didn’t know where I was going next. Didn’t have a fallback plan. But I had clarity. That company had taken everything I gave—and when it was inconvenient, they’d cut me loose without hesitation. I wasn’t going to let that be the final chapter. Not even close. (54)

As I walked through the parking lot, I didn’t look back. Not once. Some people need closure. I didn’t. I’d already made peace with who I was: the kind of man who steps in when others hesitate. The kind who loses jobs, not because he fails—but because his standard exposes those without one. (51)
