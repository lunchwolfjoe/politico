Chapter 5: The House With No Water

They say every man has a rock bottom. Mine didn’t come with a bottle or a needle. It came with a Home Depot receipt, a broken water heater in the back of my truck, and a sudden realization that I couldn’t afford to install it. Not after child support enforcement hit. Not after Walmart fired me. Not after I lost everything except the roof over my head—and even that came with its own rusted curse. The house had no water. None. Just a pipe dream and a promise I couldn’t yet cash. But it was mine.

We bought it for $47,000 in Florida. No running water, no working appliances, and a smell like wet drywall and abandoned hope. But we didn’t have a choice. We didn’t qualify for traditional loans, and even if we did, no one was going to hand us a key to anything move-in ready on what we were pulling in. I’d just been fired from a six-figure job. Ashley was teaching and doing side work where she could. We found the listing online and drove out, and the place looked worse in person. But I could see the bones. I could see the shape of what it could be if I did the work myself.

We moved in with no plumbing and no HVAC. I dug a trench by hand in the Florida heat to try and repair the main line, only to find out the water meter had been pulled by the county. No service. No utility bill. No welcome packet. Just a yellow tag that said "NON-READ." That’s how they classify your existence when your house doesn’t have a heartbeat. And yet, we made it work.

The porta potty in the yard was rented monthly. I showered at the YMCA. I brought my own towel, kept shampoo and a razor in a gym bag, and tried to act like this was just part of a workout routine. The truth was, I’d spend 20 minutes in that shower not because I was sore, but because it was the only place in town where I felt human. Warm water. Clean tiles. No mold. No drywall dust clinging to my eyelashes.

At home, we ran an extension cord from the one functioning outlet to power a shop fan and a mini fridge. We cooked on a camp stove in the corner of what would eventually be the kitchen. There were days we didn’t eat right and nights when sleep came in fits because the air was thick with humidity and drywall particles. But we kept working.

I taught myself how to hang cabinets, how to seal tile, how to frame and wire a wall to code. YouTube became my trade school. I’d work until my hands were cracked and bleeding, then watch tutorials at night on how to do it better the next day. Every fixture I installed felt like a small victory. I started taking pictures—not for Instagram, but to remind myself that something had changed. That I was building again.

We lost 40 pounds between us—not for fitness, but because of stress and labor. We sold our classic car to buy appliances. I traded in my Challenger for a work truck. We were climbing out one screw, one cut, one tile at a time.

I remember the day we bought a water heater. It felt like a miracle. We had saved up, found one on clearance, and drove it home in the back of a borrowed truck. I wheeled it up the walkway like it was sacred. Hooked it up. And then—child support enforcement hit. Not because I wasn’t paying. But because the wage order from my old job hadn’t cleared the new system yet. I was out of work. Their algorithm didn’t care.

My paycheck was garnished before it ever hit. And with the way the new calculation worked, they based it off my old income. It didn’t matter that I was making minimum wage now. I got $156 every two weeks. And that’s when I realized: I couldn’t afford to hook up the damn heater. The water was cold again.

But we kept going. Because giving up would’ve been easier. And easy never made me.

The thing people forget about pride is that it doesn’t always wear a suit. Sometimes it wears work gloves and shows up at 3 a.m. to rip out floor joists by hand. Sometimes pride looks like not asking your family for a dollar, even when your checking account says $7.42 and your gas tank is flashing E. I could’ve asked for help. But I didn’t. Not once. Not from the government. Not from relatives. Not even when the fridge broke and we lived off peanut butter sandwiches for two weeks. I wanted to know I could come back the hard way—because that was the only way it would mean something.

Eventually, I found work again—graveyard shift stocking shelves at Sam’s Club. It was a demotion in every sense of the word. I went from running one of the most profitable Walmart stores in the country to being just another name on a clipboard. The paycheck was about 20% of what I used to make. No benefits. No respect. But it was a job. And it meant I could keep the lights on and keep building.

There was one night, after a shift, that I sat in the truck and just stared at the steering wheel. My hands were raw, my back ached, and I hadn’t eaten since the granola bar Ashley slipped into my bag before I left. I was angry—at the system, at Walmart, at myself for believing the rules would protect me. But under that anger was resolve. I wasn’t done yet. I still had chapters left to write.

There were days I questioned everything. Not just what I was doing—but who I was now. I’d stare at the kitchen walls, unfinished and bare, and wonder if I’d been fooling myself this whole time. If all that grind—the medals, the leadership awards, the peak shrink numbers—meant anything in a country where you can be erased over a policy footnote. But those thoughts never lasted long. Because every time I considered quitting, I’d remember I wasn’t doing this just for me. I was doing it for the woman beside me who hadn’t once complained. For the daughters who deserved to see what rebuilding looks like, up close and unfiltered.

Ashley was the one who held the seams together when everything frayed. She lost her mom during this time—breast cancer—and still found a way to work, teach, take care of the girls, and push me forward. There were days she’d leave before sunrise and come home after dark, then help paint a wall or scrub grout lines until midnight. She never asked when it would get easier. She only asked what we needed to do next. That kind of partnership doesn’t come from fairy tales. It comes from fire. We were in it together. And that mattered more than anything.

Then came the unemployment fight.

Walmart didn’t just fire me—they contested my claim. Said I violated policy, end of story. They sent a market HR rep to the hearing. I thought maybe they’d let it slide, like most companies do. But they didn’t. They showed up. Hard. Jason Winkler. Brandon Sharp. Jeremy Metz. Names I won’t forget. They didn’t just oppose the claim—they testified. Fought like I was a threat to their reputation. Like I hadn’t paid into that system with every check for years. Like I was the problem.

I represented myself. Told the truth. The administrative judge ruled against me. Said Walmart followed policy. Said contact was made. I stood outside that hearing room and laughed—not because it was funny, but because it was absurd. I wasn’t asking for welfare. I was asking for what I earned. And they buried it.

We pushed forward anyway. Ashley picked up more side gigs—tutoring, writing, anything she could. We started tracking every penny on a whiteboard in the living room. Rent, gas, drywall, food. If it wasn’t on the board, it didn’t exist. That’s how tight it got.

The worst moment came the same day we bought our first real comforts—a hot water heater and a mount-on-the-fridge water filter. I remember being excited. Like little kids. We’d finally have clean drinking water and a warm shower. Two hours later, I got the call. Child support had garnished what little I had left. We couldn’t afford to install either.

The water was cold again. The sink stayed dry. The fridge filter went unused.

I sat on the floor that night staring at both boxes like they were mocking me. I’d finally clawed my way back to something—and the rug got yanked again. But that’s the thing about men built from pressure. You can knock us down, but you better pray we stay there. Because if we stand back up, we don’t stop.

And then—one night after a shift, while I was still in my Sam’s Club uniform—I got the call.

Amazon. A recruiter reached out. Said she got my name from someone who remembered how I ran Williston. She didn’t care about the termination. She cared about the results. Said they were launching a new fulfillment center and needed operators with scars—not résumés.

She asked if I could talk right then. I said I just got off a graveyard shift and hadn’t slept in a day. She said that was perfect. Grit was the interview. I told her I’d get cleaned up and call her back in an hour.

I hung up and just sat there. Not smiling. Not celebrating. Just still. For the first time in a year, I felt momentum shift.

The comeback had begun.

The next few days were a blur of preparation. I pulled out the one decent shirt I still owned, ironed it on the countertop using a towel and an old flat iron, and sat down to rewrite my resume. I didn’t sugarcoat anything. I put Williston’s shrink numbers front and center. I listed the operational records, the launches, the team size, the velocity. I didn’t hide the termination. I framed it for what it was—a line crossed for the right reason. I told myself: if they can’t see the value in that, they were never going to be worth working for anyway.

The phone interview was raw and fast. Katon Bethay was direct. No pleasantries, no filler. He asked what I’d do with a broken launch team, how I’d reset inbound operations when the dock plan failed, how I’d handle associates walking out mid-shift. I answered with stories, not theory. He paused once, then said, "You’re the first one who answered without checking with HR policy."

Next came the writing sample. They gave me a scenario: dock-to-stock delays, high shrink in consumables, low engagement on the night shift. I wrote a five-page breakdown—systems, process, cultural breakdowns, team audit, and frontline leadership corrections. I wrote it between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. after coming home from Sam’s Club, hands still dirty, feet numb from hours on concrete. But I wrote it like I was already in charge.

They flew me out to OAK4 for shadowing and interviews. The first day there, I saw the difference instantly. The MIT kids in starched slacks, using words like “throughput optimization” and “standard deviation failures” while I was still trying to find the damn time clock. I felt out of place—but not unqualified. I watched them miss things right in front of their faces. A broken conveyor. A picker with a jammed tote. A standup meeting that killed 20 minutes of productivity without solving a thing. I wasn’t smarter than them. I was hungrier.

That’s where I met Mike. Retired combat dog handler turned Amazon ops manager. Rough around the edges, voice like sandpaper and motor oil. He pulled me aside during lunch. Said, “You see what they don’t. Don’t let their degrees make you question your gut.”

I got the offer a week later. Fresno. FAT1. Brand new robotics site. Eighty external managers, most with no warehouse experience. They wanted me on the launch team. Wanted me fast.

We packed our bags. The house wasn’t finished yet, but it was close enough. The YMCA card went in the trash. The water heater still hadn’t been hooked up. But we’d made it. From zero to Amazon. And not because someone gave me a second chance. Because I fought for it.

We hit the road with a borrowed trailer and a used truck that sounded like it might die before we hit California. Ashley drove behind me with the girls. We had no safety net. But we had each other. I didn’t know what would happen next. But I knew this much:

The house had no water. But it taught me how to build again.

And sometimes, when everything is stripped away, what’s left is exactly what you needed all along.
