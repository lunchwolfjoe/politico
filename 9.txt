Chapter 9: The Texas That Raised Me, The One I See Now
Word Count: 0 / 5,000

I was raised by a Texas that doesn’t exist anymore. The kind where men said “sir” because they meant it, where a handshake closed a deal, and where the flag in front of the church and the one flying over the courthouse both meant the same thing. That Texas made me. It baptized me in heat, in hardship, and in honor. And now? I barely recognize the ground I swore to defend. (66)

We didn’t have much, but we had rules. You earned what you got. You looked people in the eye. You stood for the anthem and bowed your head when someone prayed. My parents weren’t rich, but they were righteous—quietly, firmly. My dad had callouses on his hands and a sermon in his back pocket. My mom stitched morality into every thread of our lives. (61)

But drive through Houston now. Walk the edges of Austin. The language’s changed. The signs have changed. The tone has changed. You see more fentanyl tents than flags. You hear more excuses than expectations. You feel it—the slippage. A place that once forged men now folds for every fragile policy cooked up by people who couldn’t survive a week of Texas sun without their HVAC and HR rep. (65)

We didn’t lock our doors growing up. Not because crime didn’t exist, but because neighbors did. Now you lock your doors, your truck, your gate—and still wonder if your kid’s going to walk past a needle in the park. That’s not just policy failure. That’s moral failure. Texas used to protect its own. Now we’re too busy protecting the feelings of strangers who don’t speak the language, respect the laws, or give a damn about the culture they walked into. (71)

I’m not anti-immigrant. I’m anti-chaos. I’ve worked with first-generation Americans who put more sweat into a single shift than some legacy kids put into a whole year. But what’s happening now at our border isn’t immigration—it’s invasion by invitation. It’s open gates and closed eyes. It’s fentanyl pouring in while DPS is told to stand down. It’s cartel scouts hiking past ranch homes while politicians send tweets. (66)

And what are we teaching our kids in the middle of this collapse? That effort is optional. That math is racist. That gender is a feeling but patriotism is problematic. I remember a time when Texas schools taught shop, taught prayer, taught kids how to change oil and stand for something. Now they teach CRT slides and pronoun exercises while we rank 38th in reading.

I went to school with Rustler jeans and iron-on patches. My daughter had a 4.5 GPA, multiple extracurriculars, national-level achievements—and couldn’t get into UT. But I’m supposed to believe the system is “equitable.” What we’ve got isn’t equity—it’s engineered decline. Rewarding everyone except the ones holding the line. (58)

Texas isn’t just a state. It’s a bellwether. What happens here doesn’t stay here—it spreads. We used to lead the nation in values, in grit, in common sense. Now we’re leading the slow roll toward federalized decay. Bureaucrats in D.C. drool over what they’re watching happen in Austin: a red state too distracted by football and barbecue to notice its foundation being swapped out for sand. (63)

We’ve got border sheriffs begging for help, and mayors rolling out welcome wagons. We’ve got school boards more focused on drag queen story hour than literacy rates. We’ve got Republican reps who post tough while the cameras are rolling and fold like lawn chairs the minute lobby money whispers in their ears. Don’t talk to me about “holding the line” when half the people in office don’t even know where the line is anymore. (65)

You want to know why I’m running? Because I remember Texas before the rot. Before the language was foreign, before the cops were scared, before the schools became babysitting centers for ideology. I remember when you could raise a family, run a business, and believe in something without being branded as dangerous by people who live off your taxes and mock your values. (59)

And I’m not coming to make friends. I’m coming to fix what they refuse to face. To say the things polite conservatives are too scared to say. To stand in the gap between what Texas was and what they’re trying to turn it into. And if that makes me a problem for the people in power—good. It means I’m doing it right. (56)

Drive 20 minutes outside any major Texas city and you’ll see two states. One still prays over dinner and teaches their kids to stand for the anthem. The other thinks faith is hate and blue-collar work is beneath them. In the country, they fix fences, raise flags, and still believe hard work pays off. In the suburbs? They Uber to therapy appointments and TikTok their outrage while their kids can’t change a tire. (66)

I talk to welders, linemen, mechanics—men who build what others just complain about. You know what they tell me? “My nephew can’t even find a trade school around here anymore.” That’s not an accident. They gutted shop classes. Closed down voc-ed campuses. And then act surprised when kids grow up without a skill, a spine, or a shot. They replaced real work with fake degrees and called it progress. (64)

You want to see how deep it goes? Ask a seventeen-year-old how to get into a plumbing program. Then ask them how to apply for loan forgiveness on a useless sociology degree. The second one’s easier—because the system isn’t built to make workers. It’s built to make dependents. That’s why Texas went from training roughnecks to importing labor. That’s why your neighbor can’t find a drywaller who speaks English. (61)

And at the center of it all? Faith. The steady, quiet backbone of Texas life. The belief that God watches, that truth matters, that what you do when no one’s looking still counts. They mocked it. Shoved it out of classrooms. Filed lawsuits to keep it off graduation stages. But they forgot something: when the lights go out, it’s still the church that feeds the hungry. Still the pastor doing wellness checks. Still the cross standing when the flag is lowered. (68)

Texas isn’t just one of fifty. It’s the firewall. The last place with enough spine, land, culture, and people to say “No more” and make it stick. But we’re losing that edge. We’re losing it in the name of growth, compromise, and silence. You don’t save Texas by getting louder in campaign ads. You save it by getting louder where it matters—at the border, in the classroom, on the jobsite, and in the damn Capitol. (66)

The people running this state want it both ways. They want to talk tough on TV and then pass milquetoast legislation that changes nothing. They want to tweet about family values while allowing CPS to tear families apart over nonsense. They want to wave the Bible around while stripping faith from every state-funded program. That’s not leadership. That’s theater. And I’m not here to act. I’m here to rip the curtain down. (64)

This campaign isn’t about symbolism. It’s about confrontation. It’s about looking the Texas political class in the eye and saying, “You’ve had your chance. Now get out of the way.” I don’t want their seat. I want their standards. Raised. Restored. Reinforced. Not by talk. By action. By pain. By sweat. The way Texans have always done it. (59)

You want to know the difference between me and the other guys? They want to be in office. I want to fix the office. Burn out the rot. Tear out the dead wood. Rebuild the beams. Not so I can sit there—but so the next generation doesn’t have to fight like hell just to stand where we once walked free. (55)

I still remember riding in the back of my dad’s truck on a Sunday morning. Fresh-pressed shirt, cowboy boots half a size too tight, Bible in my lap. He'd point at fences and barns and tell me who built them. “That one was Mr. Hargrove. His son didn’t turn out worth a damn, but he built a strong line.” That was the Texas I knew. Where names meant something. Where a man’s work outlived his excuses. (67)

Now? I see kids who can’t look you in the eye. Men who don’t show up when it rains. Leaders who talk values while voting like cowards. And I’m not talking about D.C.—I’m talking about right here. Local boards. State reps. Judges. The same ones who mail out campaign flyers in camo while greenlighting policies that gut rural life and criminalize hard parenting. (59)

They say we’ve modernized. That we’re “more inclusive” now. What they really mean is: we’ve traded backbone for branding. We’re too afraid to offend to protect what matters. Too dependent on consultants to listen to our own damn people. We pass resolutions and ignore revolutions—quiet ones, under the radar. In our classrooms. Our hospitals. Our hiring practices. Our streets. (60)

You want to fix Texas? Start by telling the truth: we’re not okay. Our infrastructure is cracking. Our schools are ideological landmines. Our cops are demoralized. Our border is a war zone. And the loudest voices in Austin are more worried about keeping their seats than keeping the Republic. That’s why I’m not campaigning like them. Because I’m not one of them. (60)

When I was a kid, the mayor of our town also ran the hardware store. His hands were calloused. His truck was beat-up. He didn’t have a staff—he had a notebook. He knew who needed help with their roof, who’d been drinking too much again, and who had extra eggs if your chickens weren’t laying. That was government. Not glamorous. Not polished. Just present.

Nobody asked what party you were. They asked if you showed up when it mattered. If your word meant something. If your kids had manners. If you shoveled your neighbor’s ditch without being asked. That’s the leadership standard I grew up under. And it’s the one I’m bringing back—whether they like it or not. (52)

I’ve eaten in enough backroad diners to know the anger out there is real. It’s not partisan—it’s personal. People feel betrayed. By Austin. By Washington. By the cowards who ran as conservatives and now vote like consultants. They’re tired of the lies. Tired of the silence. Tired of being told to be patient while their towns rot and their values get mocked by people who’ve never fixed a fence or balanced a budget. (64)

That’s what this campaign is. It’s not a performance—it’s a reckoning. A voice for every working Texan who’s done asking for permission. A mission for every father who’s watched the system gut opportunity from his kids. A promise to every community that’s been left behind not because it failed—but because it refused to conform. (57)

Let’s talk border. Not slogans. Not campaign soundbites. Truth. What we’ve got isn’t a crisis—it’s a collapse. If Texas was a sovereign nation, this would be an act of war. Cartels control sectors of U.S. soil. Ranchers are finding scout gear and trash piles with GPS coordinates. Women are getting trafficked, and fentanyl’s killing teenagers in every county from El Paso to Nacogdoches. And what do our state leaders do? Press conferences. Hashtags. Laws with no teeth. (74)

I’m done playing nice. We don’t need more policy. We need action. We need checkpoints, not charity. We need state-funded interdiction teams with real authority—not vague MOU partnerships with federal agencies that stab us in the back the second D.C. flips political control. And if the federal government sues us for defending ourselves? Let them. We’ll countersue for every casket fentanyl filled on our watch. (66)

Trade school revival? You bet. I’ll fund them like they matter and strip subsidies from useless programs that train activists instead of welders. I want a pipeline from high school into certifications that get kids on a job site making $70K before age 20. Not college debt. Dignity. The kind you build with your hands, not hashtags. (54)

And here’s one more thing—I want Texas to start acting like Texas again. I want nullification on federal overreach. You try to bring in ESG compliance codes that kill ranching? We block it. You sue us for defending our border? We ignore it. You mandate DEI quotas in state hiring? We laugh. This isn’t just a campaign. It’s a declaration. Texas doesn’t need to beg. We need to lead. (66)

I’m not running to join their club. I’m running to flip their damn table. To walk into those rooms in Austin and remind them who they work for. Not consultants. Not contractors. Not lobbyists with shiny brochures and six-figure wine tabs. They work for the same people I’ve been shoulder to shoulder with my whole life—the welders, the single moms, the field hands, the veterans with more scars than savings. (66)

And I’m not asking for permission anymore. I’m not waiting my turn. My turn was stolen a long time ago—when they sold out our schools, our borders, our faith, and our families. Now it’s my turn to take it back. Not with speeches. With action. With calloused hands, an iron spine, and a map of every lie they ever told us burned into my memory. (61)

This is the Texas I still believe in: not perfect, not polished—but proud. Capable. Armed with truth. We built the oil that fueled this country, the cattle that fed it, and the grit that defended it. And I’ll be damned if I sit back and watch us become another hollow blue-state experiment because our leaders are too scared to stand. (59)
[Total: 2,121]

So here I am. Loud. Unapologetic. Not polished. Not packaged. Just ready. Because I was built by the Texas that raised men. And I’m here to fight for the Texas that’s still worth saving. And I don’t care what title I have to take to do it. (50)
