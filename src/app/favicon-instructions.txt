Favicon Creation Instructions
==========================

To complete the branding with our new shield logo, create a favicon using these steps:

1. Export the shield portion of our CampaignLogo component as a square SVG
2. Use a favicon generator tool (like https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to create:
   - favicon.ico (32x32 pixels) for traditional browsers
   - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180 pixels) for iOS devices
   - android-chrome-192x192.png for Android devices
   - site.webmanifest for PWA functionality

3. Use these colors:
   - Shield outer border: #B91C1C (Red-700)
   - Inner shield: #FFFFFF (White)
   - Star and circuit lines: #1E3A8A (Blue-900)

4. Place the generated files in the src/app directory

5. Update the head section in layout.tsx to include all favicon-related links

The favicon should maintain the key elements of our shield design while being recognizable even at small sizes.
