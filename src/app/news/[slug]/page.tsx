    date: "March 25, 2024",
    category: "Media Coverage",
    description: "National media spotlight on our candidate's journey from Iraq and Guantanamo Bay deployments to leadership roles at Walmart and Amazon, showcasing his unique qualifications for Congress.",

      <p>In an exclusive interview, our candidate shares their remarkable journey from military service to corporate leadership, and now to public service.</p>

      <h2>Military Service</h2>
      <p>"My time in the JAG Corps taught me the importance of discipline, integrity, and mission-focused leadership," the candidate reflects.
