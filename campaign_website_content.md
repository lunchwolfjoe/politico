## About Me Section

### Personal Story
"As a combat veteran, technology executive, and father of two, I've dedicated my life to service and innovation. My journey from military service to tech leadership has taught me that the strongest solutions come from combining traditional values with forward-thinking approaches.

Growing up in Texas, I learned the importance of faith, family, and freedom. These values guided me through my military service, where I proudly defended our nation's interests abroad. After returning home, I channeled my leadership experience into the technology sector, where I've helped create jobs and drive innovation right here in Texas.

Today, as a father of two teenage daughters, I'm more committed than ever to securing a bright future for our next generation.
