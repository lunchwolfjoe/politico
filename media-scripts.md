**N. LEE PLUMB:**
"As someone who's managed multimillion-dollar budgets at America's largest companies, I understand economic opportunity isn't created by government—it's created by hardworking Americans when government gets out of the way.

In Congress, I'll fight for lower taxes, fewer regulations, and policies that empower small businesses to grow and innovate.

Because economic freedom isn't just about prosperity—it's about dignity, purpose, and the American Dream.

Our national security depends on military strength, secure borders, and leaders who understand that peace comes through strength.
